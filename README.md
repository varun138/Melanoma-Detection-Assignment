# Melanoma-Detection

> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Information
- Through this project trying to make a deep learning-based solution for melanoma detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where the dataset contains 2357 images of different skin diseases taken from International Skin Imaging Collaboration
- The goal is to develop a multiclass classification model that detects 9 types of skin diseases, with an emphasis on melanoma detection.
- Dataset includes:
  - Actinic keratosis
  - Basal cell carcinoma
  - Dermatofibroma
  - Melanoma
  - Nevus
  - Pigmented benign keratosis
  - Seborrheic keratosis
  - Squamous cell carcinoma
  - Vascular lesion

## Technologies Used
- python
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- pathlib
- sklearn
- Keras
- tensorflow

## Conclusions
- A CNN model was built and trained to classify 9 skin diseases.
- The model which was first built had the problem of overfitting and then we have applies data augmentation technique.
- This has significantly improved the model's performance.
- Final accuracy metrics indicate the model is reliable for classifying skin diseases, including melanoma.
